            <ul><li>The whole design of the system is based mainly on IOT which is newly introduced concept in the world of development. There is basically two parts included, the first one is hardware & second one is software.</li>
            <li>The hardware part has sensors which help to measure the real time values, another one is ESP32 converts the analog values to digital one, & smartphone shows the displays output from sensors, Wi-Fi module gives the connection between hardware and software.</li>
            <li>In software we developed a program based on embedded c language. The PCB is design at first level of construction and component and sensors mounted on it.</li>
            <li>BLYNK app is installed in the android version to see the output. When the system get started dc current given to the kit and Arduino  and WIFI gets on.</li>
            <li>The parameters of water is tested one but one and their result is given to display. The app went provided with hotspot gives the exact value as on display shows on kit.</li><li>Thus like this when the kit is located on any specific water body and WIFI is provided we can observe its real time value on our android phone anywhere at any time.</li></ul>

            <font size="4.5"><h2>CONCLUSION</h2></font>
            <p>Monitoring of Turbidity, PH & Temperature of Water makes use of water detection sensor with unique 
                advantage and existing GSM network. The system can monitor water quality automatically, and it is low in cost
                 and does not require people on duty. So the water quality testing is likely to be more economical, convenient
                  and fast. The system has good flexibility. Only by replacing the corresponding sensors and changing the relevant 
                  software programs, this system can be used to monitor other water quality parameters. The operation is simple. 
                  The system can be expanded to monitor hydrologic, air pollution, industrial and agricultural production and so on. 
                  It has widespread application and extension value.</p>
